# Three Level Password Authentication
In the digital age, the integrity of user data is the most important. With the increasing threat of cyber attacks, ensuring strong security measures is a key aspect. The Three-Level Password Authentication Project addresses this problem by implementing 
a multi-layered security system designed to protect access to web-based resources. This project is inspired by the principle that the more authentication factors an attacker has to overcome, the more resistant the system becomes against unauthorized access. The focus of the project is building the authentication system.
